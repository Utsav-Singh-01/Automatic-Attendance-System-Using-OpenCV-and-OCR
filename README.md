# Automatic-Attendance-System-Using-OpenCV-and-OCR
Project made in 4th Semester for Digital Electronics made by Utsav Singh 2K20/IT/156.

This is a python program that uses opencv and tesseract ocr to mark the attendance into an excel sheet when a student shows their ID card.
The roll number is extracted from the ID card and then the attendance is marked in the excel sheet.
This program is written specially for DTU students so current only works for ID cards of DTU students and also the excel sheet must be in a specific format,
But in the future changes can be made so that this program can be used for other colleges,schools,officies etc.
